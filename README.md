# ⛈️ Real-Time Weather Analytics Platform

## 🎯 Project Overview

A complete data engineering project demonstrating real-time and batch data processing using weather data from the NWS API. It ingests, processes, analyzes, and visualizes weather conditions, supporting ML-based forecasting and real-time alerts.

---

## 🌍 Use Case

Organizations such as logistics firms and weather-aware service providers need accurate and timely weather data for operational efficiency and risk management.

This project offers:

* Real-time streaming of weather observations
* Historical batch ETL pipeline
* Machine learning for temperature forecasting
* Dashboards for visualization

## 🔄 Architecture

```
[NWS API] --> Kafka Producer --> Kafka Topic: weather_obs
                     |
          [Spark Streaming Processor] --> Kafka Topic: weather_processed
                     |--> MongoDB (Current Observations)
                     |--> Parquet (Raw + Cleaned) --> MinIO/HDFS
                     |--> Redis (Feature Store)

[Airflow DAG] --> Loads Cleaned Data --> Data Warehouse
                                --> Triggers ML Training (Daily)
                                --> Publishes Predictions --> Kafka Topic: weather_predictions

[PowerBI Dashboard] --> Queries Data Warehouse & MongoDB
```

## 🎓 Implementation Steps

1. **Kafka Producer**

   * Polls NWS API every minute
   * Implements retry logic and error logging
   * Sends weather JSON to `weather_obs`

2. **Spark Structured Streaming**

   * Consumes `weather_obs`, cleans, converts units
   * Publishes enriched data to `weather_processed`
   * Writes current snapshots to MongoDB and rolling features to Redis

3. **Airflow DAGs**

   * Batch ETL from Parquet to Data Warehouse
   * ML pipeline (forecast model + evaluation)
   * DAGs containerized and orchestrated via Kubernetes

4. **ML Component**

   * Forecasts next-day temperature
   * Evaluates performance using MSE and R²
   * Outputs stored back to Kafka and DW

5. **PowerBI Dashboard**

   * Visualizes current observations, historical trends, predictions

6. **Prompts & AI**

   * Prompts used to auto-generate DAGs, UDFs, and documentation
